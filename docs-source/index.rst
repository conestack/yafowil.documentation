YAFOWIL documentation
=====================


**Yet Another Form WIdget Library** (XHTML).

    `Callables Everywhere`

YAFOWIL offers html form creation and modification at runtime. It is lightweight
and provides an extensible, reusable set of form widgets, independent of any
web-framework, but easy to use in your web framework.

YAFOWIL is framework independent and is all about widgets and configuration.
It does not fight with storage.
